# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application that allows users to create, edit or delete appointments. The project allowed me to practice and improve my React skills with various hooks, custom hooks and components. Getting the front end online and attaching it to the api which held the data was very exciting. Can be viewed at https://the-appointment-scheduler.netlify.app
